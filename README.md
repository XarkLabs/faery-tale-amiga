# The Faery Tale Adventure - macOS/SDL2

Xark of [XarkLabs](https://XarkLabs.com)

This is my attempt to get The Faery Tale Adventure to run on a modern platform.

Initial target is macOS/SDL2, but after that it should hopefully be fairly portable to other platforms.

I would like to thank Talin for releasing this code (and Joe for keeping a copy around)!

I was very proud to have played a very small part in the original Amiga version back in the day, and I am similarly proud to get a chance to "hack on" the code now.
